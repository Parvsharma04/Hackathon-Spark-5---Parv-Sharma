## Introduction

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to create tasks, set bounties, and complete tasks for rewards. The decentralized nature of this platform ensures that users have full ownership of their tasks and rewards, with no central entity controlling the platform.

## Features

- **Decentralized User Authentication**: Secure and private user authentication using wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
- **Post Tasks**: Users can create, edit, and delete their tasks stored on the blockchain.
- **Set and Claim Bounties**: Users can set bounties for tasks, and other users can claim them upon completion.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Task and bounty data is stored on a decentralized network, making it resistant to censorship.
- **User-Owned Data**: Users have full ownership of their data, including tasks and bounties.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Web3.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: IPFS for decentralized storage
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask
- **Testing**: Hardhat/Truffle, Mocha, Chai

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed
